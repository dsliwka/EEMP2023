## The Empirical Evaluation of Management Practices

### University of Cologne

#### Winter 2023/24

_Prof. Dr. Dirk Sliwka and Sander Kraaij_

### Organizational Issues

- The sessions take place on _Mondays (14:00-17:45)_ and _Tuesdays (09:00-11:45)_ during the first term of the semester.
   	- **Note that the first lecture is in a different room**: 100 Hörsaal V.
	- Note that we start an hour later on Tuesday than announced on KLIPS.
 	- Note that the first lecture is in a different room.
- We will be using Google Colab throughout the course, **including the exam**.
	- You can find information about this service [here](https://colab.research.google.com/).
	- Please bring a laptop (or tablet with keyboard) to all sessions because we will be interactively working with python in Google Colab.
	- Since Google Colab requires an internet connection, please make sure you have a working connection at the university.
	- Google Colab also requires a Google account. If you do not have an account, you can create one for free. You do not need to add any personal information to your account to use Colab.
- **Exam:**
  - First Exam: November 21, 2023, 10:00-11:00, location TBA
  -	Second exam: TBA
  -	Registration for the exam takes place as usual on KLIPS. If you are a doctoral student and do not have access to the course on KLIPS, please write to kraaij[at]wiso.uni-koeln.de that you want to take the exam.
  -	You will write the exam on your own laptop or tablet, so please bring it. Make sure it is fully charged because there may not be enough power outlets for everybody.
  -	You may only use one screen (laptop or tablet) during the exam. You may not use your phone.
  -	This is an open book exam, so you are allowed to use books and online resources. However, you are not allowed to communicate with anybody. We will check this by looking at your screens. Furthermore, we can see if you're collaborating on Colab.
  -	You will access the exam through a link written on the board or screen in the exam room. The link only allows you to view the exam, so before you start working on it, you need to create a copy using "File > Save a copy in Drive" in Colab. You must rename this copy according to the instructions written at the top of the exam.
  -	At the end, you will share your exam with eemp.exams@gmail.com using the "Share" button in Colab.
  -	This [video](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AMWOPjDJqEhFU6U&cid=492CFFDBC915BE1A&id=492CFFDBC915BE1A%21137316&parId=492CFFDBC915BE1A%21136598&o=OneUp) is not up to date, but it explains how the exam will work in general.
